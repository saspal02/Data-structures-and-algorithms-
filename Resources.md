Learn Java Before Starting Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Before diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), it’s important to learn a programming language. Java is a great choice for its versatility, but it can feel challenging because it’s an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language and is verbose. Here’s a short guide to get started effectively:

1. Recommended Java Course
